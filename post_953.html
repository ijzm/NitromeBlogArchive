                                                <p>Today  we want to talk about some advert changes that we have made. You may have  noticed over the last couple of years that we experimented a lot with  ads? Let&apos;s be honest here... you may have noticed about us experimenting  in adding more ads to the site?</p>
<p>Firstly we would like to assure you that  it was not lead by greed... we only put ads on the site to fund making  the games you love to play. In recent years this has been much more of a  struggle as both a lot of browser gamers and ad networks have shifted  focus to mobile games. The lowest point for us in this is when we  reluctantly turned on pop under ads... something we swore we never wanted  to do!</p>
<p>You  hopefully noticed that the pop under ads are no longer there? We  switched them off a few days before the launch of <a href="http://www.icebreaker-game.com/" target="_blank">Icebreaker: A Viking  Voyage</a>&#xA0;with the hope that it would lead to enough new revenue that we  could keep them off. We are happy to say that so far, this has been the  case!</p>
<p>So  this we hope was the turning point to a better ad experience in  the future on Nitrome.com. Today we have launched our next ad based  improvement which was made to the preroll ads that show up before the games  play. Now don&apos;t get too excited, they are still there. We like to think  however that they are now a lot slicker and less intrusive. There  should be less loading errors with this new system, there are more skippable ads and should now all pull in at the correct size within a new  container that better lets the player know what&apos;s going on.</p>
<p>We  don&#x2019;t expect us having a new ad system to be something that you all  want to celebrate but we hope you approve of the new system and agree  that it works better and more slickly than the old one. We will continue  to improve the quality of the ad experience where we can. Let us know  what you think below!</p>
<p>If anyone experiences issues with the new preloader, please leave comments, <a href="/contact/" target="_blank">email us</a>&#xA0;or private message us. We will look into any problems found.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend everyone!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
