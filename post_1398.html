                                                <p>Happy Christmas Nitromains,</p>
<p>With the holidays in full swing it feels appropriate to write a little post wishing you all a great time, to act as a round up for the year and set the sights for the year to come.</p>
<p>So this year you may have noticed we took a decidedly mobile turn. Some people think this is great but we recognise that for others they wish we would just drop all this mobile nonsense and go back to the good old days of browser games.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re in the later group we are sorry, but our current future seems to be firmly in the mobile market for the moment. Following a huge decline in the browser side of things over the last few years we had our most profitable year to date! That&apos;s some turn around, i&apos;m sure you will agree and it is all due to our new focus on mobile.&#xA0;</p>
<p>That said we are very sad to have let the web side slip as we have. Our intention from the beginning has been to produce web versions of the games and release them alongside the mobile counterparts. That has not happened. We will endevor to correct this in the new year starting with releases for Beneath the Lighthouse , GoPogo and Rust Bucket in January!</p>
<p>Also in January if all goes to plan we should see the launch of &apos;Ultimate Briefcase&apos; and content updates for both &apos;Go Pogo&apos; and &apos;Rust Bucket&apos;.</p>
<p>We have 3 games in the works that we are not talking about yet at Nitrome. That is not counting &apos;Ultimate Briefcase&apos; or &apos;Project Jump&apos; which we have talked about in the past that is still ongoing. We will start to reveal more about these projects in January.</p>
<p>Have a great Christmas everyone and we will see you all again in the New Year. =D</p>
