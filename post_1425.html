                                                <p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>we have a new game in development for Steam/PC...yes you read that right for Steam! It&apos;s called Bomb Chicken and you play as a Chicken who lays bombs rather than eggs!</p>
<p>You can&apos;t fly so but you can stack the bombs as high as you like to reach places as long as you do it before they all blow up!</p>
<p>The bombs can be kicked by walking into them which is handy if you want to tackle some of the enemies and they have a multitude of other uses too....a swiss army knife of tricks!</p>

<p>The game is currently on Steam Greenlight which is what we need to go through to get it onto Steam. If anyone has a steam account we would really appreaciate if you could head over to the page and vote for us<a title="greenlight bomb chicken" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=884620027" target="_blank"> here</a>&#xA0;</p>
<p>Finally a lot of people may see a lot of similaritys with our previously announced Steam project Flightless and they do have a lot in common. Flightless has sadly not been worked on for a long time and at this point should be considered cancelled. We may return to the project at some point as we did with Flat Pack/Project Surface but for the moment our sole Steam efforts are going towards Bomb Chicken.</p>
<p>It may seem strange to some that we have made a similar game to Flightless rather than just pick up Flightless. In truth it is mostly coincidence...we had a new idea and the art went in that direction and ended up similar. We decided it was a good fit for Steam after starting development and the time felt right to give the format another go.&#xA0;</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
