                                                <p class="MsoNormal">Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Starting Monday and every day up to and including Easter Sunday itself, there is going to be an Easter Egg that you have to find in games and site! Kind of like what we did at Christmas with the Advent Calender, only this time with Eggs! Finding the Eggs will unlock Avatars and the artists at Nitrome have really drawn some nice ones for this, so I think you&apos;re going to want them all!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Also worth noting is that we put some time into the Avatar system for this, that now means we can put avatars in almost any of our games. In the first iteration we were only picking games that were side on&#x2026;we expanded things to include more custom sprites in the Christmas update but there were technical reasons why a lot of games were not possible to be included. We have now overcome this issue so were finally able to put the Avatars in places we have been keen to do for a while!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Also this time around we have not put the Avatars in any games that already have one, or more than one in any of the upcoming games!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So who do you think is going to make the new Avatars list?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">See you Monday <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">J</span></p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
