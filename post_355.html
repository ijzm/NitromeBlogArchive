                                                <p>Some of you may remember last year at one point we mentioned we had some sequels in the works and we have seen some comments in forums commenting on the lack of them appearing before Christmas&#x2026;..you know who you are :)</p>
<p>Well they may be a little late and some of them may have even got put on hold last year but we have two of them still in production here at the moment and one of them we will be telling you a little more about in a preview very soon!</p>
<p>We do know you all want sequels to your favourite games and we do enjoy making them so there will always be more on the way but we also have lots of new ideas that we want to get out there and with over 80 games already developed we are never going to manage to work on everyone&#x2019;s favourite!</p>
<p>The best games will usually get sequels at some point though so be patient as good things come to those who wait :)</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
