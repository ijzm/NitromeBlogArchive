                                                <p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>after a relaxing weekend recouperating from the Nitrome Jam we are back in the office and finally ready to reveal the games to you all. We have had a few teathing problems getting them up as you may have noticed but we think we have it sorted so we will be going through and setting them live as quickly as we can.</p>
<p>We have truely been blown away not only that all the 7 Nitrome teams managed to complete a game in a week but also at the sheer quality of some of the games that were submitted from outside of the Nitrome office. The level of support for the Jam has been truely humbling.</p>
<p>We always said in the office that we would see how this Jam went before commiting to any future events but we all had such fun this time that I think it is highly likely that we will see an NitromeJam 2015 :)</p>
