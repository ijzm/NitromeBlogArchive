                                                <p>Hi Nitromians!</p>
<p>We are going to be introducing the account updates soon and should also be bringing with them... Status updates!</p>
<p>The status updates will be a great tool to tell others a little bit about yourself or to just impart some wisdom on people that pass by your profile page. We have completely overhauled the profile page and the way you can interact with features. You will also get to see other peoples avatar pages to see what they have unlocked, or to see what is possible to collect!</p>
<p>Something we are really happy with is the notification/top-profile panel upgrade. As you may have seen from Thursday&apos;s post image, we are streamlining your approach to account usability. You&apos;ll get an overview of all new things that are related to your profile and interactions (comment replies, avatars, messages, friend requests).</p>
<p>So now, no matter wherre you are on the site, you&apos;ll get to see anything new that happens by checking out the top-right profile box. Oh, and it will update even if you happen to be playing a game. You won&apos;t need to leave the game page in order to see notifications tick up.</p>
<p>Well, I guess what we are trying to say is that there is a lot of added functionality to expect. As soon as we feel we are ready to start rolling out the update, we will let you all know!</p>
<p>Until then, as always, happy gaming!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Tom</b></p>
