<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">It&apos;s been a while since we have posted... we&apos;ll anything really. The good news is that it&apos;s not because we have been slacking off. In-fact, we are working harder than ever on a whole bunch of brand new exciting games.<br> <br> You already know about Rustbucket and Gopogo, But we also have another two games in the early stages of development. We are as ever remaining tight lipped about them for now, but stay tuned to hear more about these in the coming weeks.<br> <br> Now back to the games you already know are coming!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Beneath The Lighthouse - We were really pleased with the response on this game. We really do love and appreciate all of our fans and try our best to update and get it working on as many devices as possible. This was quite a large intensive title, so thank you for your feedback, kind words and patience. The web build is undergoing some testing at the moment so with any luck (fingers and toes crossed) you all shouldn&apos;t have to wait too much longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Gopogo - is our next upcoming game. And you might be surprised to hear that it&apos;s ALREADY finished, submitted and awaiting review on the stores. We are really happy with the way it has turned out and will fill you in with some snippets of info and teasers soon, #Hypetrain!<br> <br> Rustbucket - Our spiritual successor to Turnament is coming along v-nicely. We&apos;ve been working hard on a super fun procedurally generated dungeon so it&#x2019;s different every time you play.<br> It will have some sort of level based challenge structure that sits alongside this mode to ease the turnbased newbie&#x2019;s into the carnage of the endless mode. <br> We are also planning a series of updates in which more levels with new themes and challenges are introduced. For anyone who remotely enjoyed the original, its going to be epic!<br> <br> More news on our upcoming titles coming next week. Stay tuned and have a great weekend. =3&#xA0;</span></p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Jon</b></p>
