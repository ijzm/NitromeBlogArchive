                                                <p>We hope you are excited for the&#xA0;<a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/hotair/" target="_blank">Hot Air</a> follow up game release!</p>
<p>We thought we would give you a little info on some of what you can expect. First up is the title which is NOT going to be Hot Air 3! We are intending to go with the title Hot Air Jr. We have a few reasons for this decision...</p>
<p>First up (and potentially a spoiler!) is that at the end of <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/hotair2/" target="_blank">Hot Air 2</a> they have a child so we thought it was a nice idea to be able to play as that child. We also thought that, as there has been a big gap since the last title and we have an all new engine, giving it a none-sequel title would make the game more attractive to people not familiar with the franchise.</p>
<p>There is a small element that the title suggests the game could be easier too which has some truth to it though it will certainly not be so much easier but more a result of an aspect of the new engine.</p>
<p>So we mentioned the &#x2018;new engine&#x2019; twice, what gives with that I hear you ask?</p>
<p>The big thing we hear in feedback about the original two games is that it is too unforgiving that everything makes you pop so we decided to look at that aspect. In the new game regular walls will not pop you so you only have to deal with the obstacles and walls that do have spikes placed on them. This makes the game easier but in general we use it to give the player a break in between areas and to put focus more on the obstacles than the walls.</p>
<p>Although we are making changes to make the game more approachable we want to make sure that the core things that made the original games great are still here in the third release. We think the key ingredient is variety and we plan to keep with the format of Hot Air 2 of having a new element every single level!</p>
<p>Because we have made some pretty big changes to the engine we would love to get your feedback so we plan to release a demo of the game prior to the full release so look out for that coming soon!</p>
