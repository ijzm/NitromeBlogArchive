                                                <p>The new Cheese Dreams remake is going to be arriving very soon now and we were thrilled by the response that the little trailer received from you all.</p>
<p>Some of you seemed to think we were indicating in the trailer that the game is two player. Sorry to those we confused but this is not the case so we thought as a final update we would explain the feature that had you all speculating.</p>
<p>In New Moon there are other planets (or planet type things for those of you that would like to point out that moons are not planets). The planets are trapped on the mouse ship with you and it&apos;s your task to free them from their prisons and lead them to safety. Each planet has a different behaviour and you have to figure out how to manipulate that behaviour to get them to the exit!</p>
<p>Get ready for the game soon!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
