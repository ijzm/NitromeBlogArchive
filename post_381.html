                                                <p>The more observant amongst you may have noticed a heart symbol in one of our designs for the new site and today we want to let you know a little more about what the intent is with this element. It is in essence a &#x2018;like&#x2019; button so if you click it in the new system it means you like it or as we will probably be calling it &#x2018;heart&#x2019; it or possibly &#x2018;love&#x2019; it&#x2026;..but that might be a bit too girly for the boys</p>
<p>What is probably more interesting is how we are going to use that information. For starters you will be able to see the games you have hearted in a section within &#x2018;games&#x2019; so there will be a quick easy way to find your favorites. You will also be able to see with a quick rollover on the front page which games are hearted there and we will in time add more ways to view your hearted games more easily</p>
<p>This feature won&#x2019;t only be used for you however&#x2026;..we will be using the number of &#x2018;hearts&#x2019; a game gets to gauge popularity and the first place you will see the effect of this will be in the top 5 games which in the new design will be based on the (daily) number of &#x2018;hearts&#x2019; the games gets. There will also likely be an area in games featuring the games in popularity order!</p>
<p>In the future the hearting system will apply to other areas of the site too so you will be able to rate other things and interact in other ways that we are not ready to mention.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
