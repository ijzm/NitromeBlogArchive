                                                <p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>when we did the last memory lane about Chick Flick a few of you asked to see the original art so they could see how it had changed. Well that was the original plan but was left out due to Mat being off at the time and him not mentioning it in the notes...doh!</p>
<p>So this is a small update to that to show you the original art. As you can see it is much the same as how it turned out in vectors which is not surprising given that it was the same artists working on both but you can clearly see the pixels in the original phone versions much smaller screen.</p>
<p>A few of you also asked to see the original video we made to show it off. We hunted high and low to find it in all our old back ups but unfortunately could not find it so we will have to consign that to memories.</p>
<p>One final interesting fact was that the phone version was going to have a secret stage that arose from a programming glitch. The way you rendered in J2ME was very different from how we used to program in flash in and you had to tell the screen to refresh the parts you wanted to refresh or it would paint each frame over itself as it moved. We accidentally left this on and thought it looked cool and surreal despite making the game much harder. New had the background designed like a tv tuning card which highlighted the effect really nicely on top. As this was not the way flash rendered things it did not make it into the flash version.</p>
<p>You can see a few other images from the game <a title="Chick Flick Mobile" href="http://nitrome.wikia.com/wiki/Mobile_Chick_Flick" target="_blank">here</a> on the Nitrome Wiki (yes even we use it to find things about Nitrome)</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
