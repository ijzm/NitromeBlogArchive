                                                <p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>Recently I have been talking to the folks at the Nitrome Wiki about potentially giving them their own section within the blog.</p>
<p>The Nitrome Wiki for those who don&apos;t know is a very extensive resource built up by loyal Nitrome fans about everything to do with Nitrome. There is literally everything you could ever want to know about Nitrome there and we actually use it ourselves at Nitrome to find things out sometimes as it is quicker than looking it up in our own resources!</p>
<p>This collaboration is being discussed between myself and Wiki member Nobody who a lot of you will know from all his blog comments. He is discussing with the rest of the wiki team what sort of topics they might cover so I thought I would open it up to you guys for suggestions...what would you like to see them covering? Likewise do you see any problems arising from such a collaboration that we should be prepared for? Whatever your thoughts we would love to hear what you all think!</p>
<p>As a final note...this is very much at the concept stage at the moment and nothing has been finalised. As such there is even the chance that this could still not happen, but we are hopeful this will become something very special.</p>
<p>You can visit the Nitrome Wiki <a title="Nitrome Wiki" href="http://nitrome.wikia.com/wiki/Nitrome_Wiki" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
