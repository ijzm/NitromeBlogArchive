                                                <p>Hello Nitromians,</p>
<p>today marks the Nitrome teams last working day in the office. Many of the team need to fly home to their family&apos;s and generally it is good for us to take a break from things and regain some energy so we take around a week off at this time. We will be back in the office come the new year.</p>
<p>Unlike previous years this does not mean all things will be stopping while we are gone as we still have a daily avatar release set up on auto pilot for you to find in the Calendar!</p>
<p>We also as long as nothing goes wrong should be launching Bad Ice-Cream 3 just as soon as we are sure we have squashed the few bugs we have found in play testing.</p>
<p>We will have the usual pixel love games go up on Mondays!</p>
<p>Finally we also took on the challenge of doing a blog post a day until Christmas and although we dropped the ball due to technical problems for one day we still intend to stick with it as planned until Christmas Day!</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone who follows what we do and have a great Christmas everyone!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
