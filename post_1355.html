                                                <p>Hey Nitromians,<br><br>We have just released a brand new Pixelove called <a title="Play Through" href="http://www.pixellovegames.com/games/through/" target="_blank">Through</a> by Goshki (Originally made for the #gbjam4 competition). What may appear at first to be a simple platformer soon becomes something entirely different (after the first few tutorial levels that is!). Levels are literally flipped around on there heads as you discover you can &apos;push&apos; through walls, thus allowing you to traverse unexplored platforms.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The graphics on this one may be simple, but we are a sucker for a interesting mechanic making this a worthy addition to our Pixelove series.&#xA0;<br><br>Apologies for missing the usual pixelove Mondays guys and gals. It was a Bank holiday (public holiday) here in the UK yesterday.</p>
<p>Some of you may be aware that we are still without a web developer at the moment, which increases everyone&apos;s workload a fair bit (*sob*). Well we are still looking and are hopeful that we will find the right<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="line-height: 11.5px;">&#xA0;candidate</span></span>&#xA0;for the role given time.</p>
<p>Until then please bear with us on the lack of website updates. We are aware that some of you are a little bit fruistrated with the lack of web releases but we are really trying our very best.<br><br>We are however as busy as ever (currently working on 4 games and a game update!) and are dying to show you what we&apos;ve been working on. Keep your eyes peeled for our upcoming game Beneith the lighthouse aswell as a slight (well quite big) change of plan for one of our other releases. <br><br>Until then, happy gaming. =)</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Jon</b></p>
