                                                <p>Hey Nitromians,</p>
<p>Rustbucket has had a second huge new update and this time we&apos;ve mainly been focusing on WEAPONS! There are 10 brand new weapon themed stages set inside a huge fire temple for you to fight through with lots of cool new mechanics and puzzles.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Also for those of you still enjoying the endless mode weve added a shop to the mix... FINALLY a real way to spend all of that gold.</p>
<p>Each weapon has been balanced to have its own plus and minus points. A Bow might be handy at long range attacks but is far less effective upclose than say a mighty battle axe. There is even a new way to smash those annoying statues thanks to the huge warhammer weapon, so there is no excuse not to &quot;smash&quot; your highscores.</p>
<p>Happy gamng =)</p>
<p>p.s We know we have neglected the site a lot of late. You&apos;ll find that we are very active on Twitter (@nitrome) due to it being just so easy to pick up and quickly post at any time of day. There has been a lot of news that you might have missed, but we aim to post the most important pieces here for you all to enjoy.</p>
<p>Needless to say there are plenty of amazing new games that we are working on right now, so stay tuned!&#xA0;</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>nitrome</b></p>
