<p>Ok so hopefully we managed to surprise you with this!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nitrome.com/steam/flightless/">Flightless</a> will be, with your help, our first full PC download game available through Steam!<br>The game is an epic puzzle metrovania platform game for one or two players drop in drop out co-op split screen! You play as ducks that have had their wings clipped for stealing and to pay it back you must search for gems to pay back your debt in a huge dungeon full of monsters and traps.</p>
<p>With clipped wings flying and even jumping are not possible but luckily you have a magic ladder to help you out. Press the action key and it will cast a ladder upwards or downwards until it hits something.</p>
<p>Use this to climb round the levels, take out enemies, trigger switches, weigh down pressure pads, bend round corners (what?) and much more!</p>
