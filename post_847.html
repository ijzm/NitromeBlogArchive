                                                <p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>You may have noticed that we did not do a Friday Update last week. We were talking about it on Friday between the staff at Nitrome and decided against posting it because we didn&#x2019;t want people to miss the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWghcXtDHQY" target="_blank">Test Subject Complete trailer</a>. This also led to a deeper discussion about the Friday updates in general. I wanted to share the highlights of what we discussed:</p>
<p>Friday updates block less frequent visitors from seeing the main news of the week.</p>
<p>Friday updates do not always have anything worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Friday updates are supposed to be a weekly round up and also let people know what is coming the following week. The problem is we often run out of time and don&#x2019;t agree what to show the next week so it is rushed.</p>
<p>It was suggested we could better cope with Friday Updates if we moved it to Monday mornings when we would have more time to put out something worth mentioning.</p>
<p>It was suggested that we don&#x2019;t post anything unless we have something worth mentioning.</p>
<p>It was highlighted that if we do not post a feature weekly that we may end up telling the fans less&#x2026;.having a fixed day of the week keeps us aware that we should post something.&#xA0;</p>
<p>So the purpose of this post is to ask you guys and gals what you think. Do you like the Friday updates?&#x2026;.do you think any of the internal comments are valid? Do you have any ideas of your own on how we could do this better&#x2026;or should we just scrap it?</p>
<p>Just so you don&#x2019;t all miss out on the news. Coming up soon we want to start showing off a new i.p. we have been working on alongside Test Subject Complete. We also want to give you all a much requested update on Icebreaker which we have been a little quiet on.</p>
