                                                <p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>Some of you may have noticed that we briefly launched accounts earlier today. Well we are sorry to say that due to an overwhelming level of bugs that came up at launch we have had to take them back down while we investigate what went wrong. We are sorry to disappoint you with this and we did fully intend to have ready for to you this week.</p>
<p>Believe us when we say your not as sorry as us.</p>
<p>The good news is that we feel fairly positive that whatever went wrong should be sortable by early next week... maybe even Monday with a bit of luck. So cross your fingers for us and we will see you all next week. We should also have some more Touchy news regarding the 2.0 update coming soon and some news for what we have been working on post-launch with Icebreaker!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Tom</b></p>
