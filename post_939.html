                                                <p>Following on from the <a href="/blog/articles/938">news of Cheese Dreams: New Moon</a> yesterday we thought we would update you all on the progress made with Test Subject Arena 2. The game is currently working very nicely in multiplayer mode where with <a href="/touchy/" target="_blank">Touchy</a> you can now play with up to 4 people! We have been making various arenas and have been testing and balancing the abilities of the various characters.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Each character is a little different from each other this time round so the Rex suit can hang on ceilings and to compensate other characters have different advantages. Some characters are faster than others or shoot faster but there are also some other one off properties too that we will let you guess at for now!</p>
<p>The game in multiplayer is getting fairly far along now so we wanted to look again at single player, which is something we didn&apos;t have in the original.</p>
<p>We spent some time in the original trying to make a convincing AI opponent and failed dismally! Though we could make a character move around the arena... getting it to do this intelligently and to choose when to stand and shoot or when to run just proved too big of a challenge for the time we had.</p>
<p>It would have taken far longer than the whole of the rest of the game and it was decided not to be worth it in what was realistically a multiplayer game.</p>
<p>The same is still the case now but this time out we have some different ideas for what we could do for single player. We are only just looking at this now so it may yet not pan out but hey at least you know we&apos;re looking at it right!? Plus at this stage if you want to speculate on what the single player entails you may even suggest something we hadn&apos;t considered and make it even better!</p>
<p>You can look forward to Test Subject Arena 2 soon...ish!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
