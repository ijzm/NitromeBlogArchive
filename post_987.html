                                                <p>Wow Nitromians&#x2026; we have to admit we had no expectations of telling you prior to launch what the final flavour was in the upcoming Bad IceCream 3! We were so confident you wouldn&apos;t guess it that we challenged you all to guess away and you really did shooting past 300 comments! It didn&apos;t even take a full day though for Leonard Greenland to correctly guess that the final Ice-Cream flavour was Bacon... it blows us away that you guys guessed it!</p>
<p>It started off as a joke in the office that we would do bacon flavour but when we looked it up we were surprised to find it was real which settled us on the idea!</p>
<p>A little history... in 1973 the comedians &apos;The Two Ronnie&apos;s&apos; joked about the possibility of a Smokey Bacon Ice-Cream in a sketch which also joked about the possibility of a Cheese and Onion and other crisp flavours of Ice-Cream.</p>
<p>A Bacon and Egg Ice-Cream was created for real in 1992 by Aldrich&apos;s Beef and Ice-Cream Parlor as an April Fools joke. They made 15 gallons of it and offered it free to anyone who would try it.</p>
<p>It was eventually made tasteful by celebrity UK chief Heston Blumenthal, when he infused an egg custard with bacon to make bacon and egg ice-cream. You would think it would be disgusting but critics seemed to dig it?!</p>
<p>So there you go a real flavor... who would have thought it!</p>
<p>One other reason we thought this flavour would work is colour, which we noticed a few of you were thinking about in your guesses&#x2026; very clever of you ;) It&apos;s important for the ice-creams to stand out from each other and we didn&apos;t have a red one, so bacon while not the first suggestion was a good fit here!</p>
<p>You can look forward to the full game soon, so in the meantime get some practise in with the original games here:</p>
