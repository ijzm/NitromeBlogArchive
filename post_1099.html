                                                <p class="MsoPlainText">Hey Nitromians,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Great news! Icebreaker is FINALLY <a title="Icebreaker Amazon store" href="http://amzn.to/1oa6RTi" target="_blank">out on Amazon!</a></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">During the <strong><a title="nitrome jam" href="/jam/" target="_blank">#nitromejam</a></strong> Icebreaker: A Viking Voyage silently released on the Amazon App Store for Kindle Fire devices. We weren&apos;t really expecting it to happen, as we had so many problems leading up to this point. We want to rectify that right now. So if you have a Kindle and have been feeling a little left out you can go now and find out what all the fuss has been about.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Another thing that happened during the <strong><a title="Nitrome jam" href="/jam/">#nitromejam</a></strong> was that an update launched across iOS for Icebreaker. We have fixed an issue which prevented people with the original iPad from being able to play the game anymore... sorry! This means they can finally play the Kraken pack, yippee. The issue also helps users that didn&apos;t want to upgrade their OS. There is a host of minor fixes that we put into the new build, so it&apos;s worth an update.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">We also launched a new Android build which fixed a bunch of the most common issues people reported. The main offender was a bug which was causing players to lose their pars and coins from their game save. This issue was particularly hard to track down but we got there in the end ;)</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">We are looking at other issues people have been reporting and will continue to fix things where we can.<br> <br> Next week we will be revealing some of the other things we have been working on. Until Monday have a great weekend.&#xA0;</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Jon</b></p>
