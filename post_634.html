<p>Hi Nitromians!</p>
<p>It has been a while since we gave you the last update as to what is happening with the user accounts, so today I thought I would let you know what&#x2019;s currently happening with our upcoming site features. I&#x2019;ll also take this opportunity to let you know why it&#x2019;s taking us a little longer than originally anticipated.</p>
<p>We have been experimenting with our ads lately to help us strike a reasonable balance in revenue whilst not adversely affecting your gaming experience.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious changes included adding the &#x2018;balloon panel&#x2019; on our game pages. We are aware that it isn&#x2019;t the prettiest solution for the time being, yet it has been a relatively quick way for us to help with our ad revenue whilst not hindering the games or your game play.</p>
<p>We know that we&#x2019;ll be able to make much better use of the space when we introduce the next major site update, accounts!</p>
<p>The advertising issue has taken away some time from the development of really fun stuff, like user accounts, but it was very important.</p>
<p>We have also got a new member on the Nitrome team, Jack, and he will be taking care of our ads, freeing up time to focus on the site update.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m very happy to say that we are now currently back to work on the new site update, accounts and more features!</p>
<p>I have attached a preview of a new avatars section that will be included in the update. You may also notice that we will be including a search bar.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;ll make it easier to find games, news and friends! :)</p>
