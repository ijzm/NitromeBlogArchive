                                                <p>Ooh look we have a new banner... yay!<br><br>Unfortunately it&apos;s not for anything that exciting... It&apos;s more practical. There are some more interesting categories coming!<br><br>This new category in the blog is going to let you know about any maintenance work to the site or games. So for example if we make an update to fix a bug in a game we will let you know here.<br><br>Recently a few of you might have noticed that the site has been acting a bit wonky. Our old hosting wasn&apos;t really up to the task of serving the games to all of you so we have been swapping over to a new server solution with the friendly folk at <a href="http://www.peer1.com" target="_blank">Peer 1</a>. <br><br>Swapping hosting is never without its problems though and this one has had its fair share of teething problems. It&apos;s mostly sorted out now but we want to quickly let you know what has been fixed and what we are planning to fix soon.<br><br>Most importantly you should all have noticed that the site is loading a lot faster than it did before thanks to Peer1&apos;s whizzy content delivery network.<br><br>What most of you will have also noticed is that some of your game saves have disappeared. This is an unfortunate side-effect of the swap that couldn&apos;t have been avoided - but not to worry, help is at hand. If you really need to retrieve your game saves we&apos;ve written a handy little tutorial <a href="http://cdn.nitrome.com/images/blog/retrieving_game_saves.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. There are some games that haven&apos;t been affected yet: Mirror Image, Twin Shot, Flash Cat, Icebreaker, Frost Bite 2, Numbskull, Fat Cat, Flipside and Toxic 2. We will have to swap these games over soon but we thought we&apos;d give you all a little advance warning on the latest games to lessen the blow.<br><br>Another important thing that is not working yet is the highscores. We are aware of this and we are working on a fix at the moment so please bear with us.<br><br>You might also notice that the Balloon Maker has disappeared. Unfortunately this became so popular that the number of balloons created grew to such a size that we were unable to retrieve the files to swap them over to the new hosting. You guys made over 10 million balloons!! At the present time we are not sure what is going to happen with the balloon maker however we might resurrect it at some point in the future.<br><br>Finally we know a few of you have been asking us why we haven&apos;t updated the skin in a while... It&apos;s because we&apos;ve been busy swapping the site. We do have a new one coming pretty soon now though so look out for that!<br><br>Phew! That&apos;s it for now - we will try to keep you all updated.</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
