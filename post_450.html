                                                <p>Hi Nitromians!</p>
<p>Today we have a little surprise for you in the form of a spin off to our Test Subject Series (<a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/testsubjectblue/index.html" target="_blank">Test Subject Blue</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/testsubjectgreen/index.html" target="_blank">Test Subject Green</a>)&#x2026; <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/testsubjectarena/index.html" target="_blank">Test Subject Arena!</a>&#xA0;While we were making the second Test Subject game we wondered about the potential for fun in the game with two player.</p>
<p>We decided the game was a little linear to get much extra from making it co-op but as&#xA0;an arena game we felt it could have a lot of potential for fun tactics. We had a little play at the end of making Test Subject Green and it turns out we were right so we fleshed it out into a little spin off release.</p>
<p>WARNING: The game is two player only (no single player mode!). We would have loved to have added single player but the work involved in the AI (especially with the portals) didn&#x2019;t seem worth it when it is most fun as a two player experience. We have never made a two player only game before on Nitrome so please do let us know what you think via <a href="http://www.facebook.com/nitrome" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nitrome" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/contact" target="_blank">Email</a>&#xA0;:)</p>
<p>If it is popular we may even consider other two player only games in the future!</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the game that we purposely decided to leave as a surprise release!</p>
