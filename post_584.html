<p>Welcome to our newest blog category &#x2018;Memory Lane&#x2019;. Every time we feature this in the blog we will be picking out one of our past games to reminisce about. This reminiscing might feature points of interest about the games development, initial sketches or other interesting things about the franchise as a whole.</p>
<p>On the front page there is a picks section (when we haven&#x2019;t got a category such as winter taking its place) every time we feature something in memory lane, it will take place in one of the game slots. We will use this feature to keep the section fresh and make you aware of some of our older classics.</p>
<p>Our first pick for memory lane is <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/squaremeal" target="_blank">Square Meal</a> which was our last game before we expanded to our London based offices and started taking on more staff. Of more interest to people though would be the fact that we started development on a follow-up which later got put on hold and we never got back to. The <a href="http://cdn.nitrome.com/images/horror/tile.png" target="_blank">Halloween skin</a> actually features one of the new enemies that were intended to be in the game&#x2026; the <a href="http://cdn.nitrome.com/blog/images/were_square.gif" target="_blank">Weresquare</a>!</p>
<p>The idea of the enemy was that it would be timid and run away from you but then transform into a beast that would come after you! Although we don&#x2019;t have any immediate plans we may still go back at some point and make the game, but for now it&#x2019;s still on hold.</p>
