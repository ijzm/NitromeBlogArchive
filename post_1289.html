<p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>Big news our next game Silly Sausage in Meat Land will be hitting app stores this Wednesday! Yes you heard that right THIS WEDNESDAY!! (cue epic echo sound). We held off on telling you as we made a last minute change to the app which because of submission times might have meant it was delayed a week. Thankfully that has turned out not to be the case.</p>
<p>Silly Sausage is like a cross between Mario world and Snake&#x2026;well that&#x2019;s about as close a comparison as we can make to anything.</p>
<p>The game will also be hitting the website though there will be a bit of a delay. This will be the first of our Unity made games which we will be providing in both Unity Player and Web GL formats. This should really up the compatibility of the game for any of you that have been having issues in the past but were still setting it up so that&#x2019;s the main reason it is running a little behind.</p>
<p>Oh and you might want to check the fancy new trailer. If you read this far and didn&#x2019;t click already please do so... wait for it... now!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Nitrome</b></p>
