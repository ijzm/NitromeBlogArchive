                                                <p>We have got a slightly different Friday Update for you this week!</p>
<p>We&#x2019;re thrilled to announce the start of a new feature coming soon to Nitrome.com</p>
<p>We are going to start offering demos for selected upcoming games. The benefits of doing this is to gain useful feedback before progressing too far with the game and to show you guys what we are currently up to.</p>
<p>Please note that we are not going to do demos for every game. We feel that for some games it would spoil the enjoyment of exploring a new mechanic for the first time. But, for the right games, it lets you try what we&#x2019;re up to and help shape it into a better game before the final game launches.</p>
<p>So what&#x2019;s a demo going to be? Is it a tech demo? Is it a small portion of the final game? Yes, no, well maybe&#x2026; The state that the demo takes will vary on a game by game basis. For the first demo, it is more of a small playground where you will get to see some of the mechanics that we are developing. It contains a lot of final art, but some art is not there yet so the final product will look a lot better still despite it being presentable at this stage. Even though it&#x2019;s not a final game, and not a level from the final game, the demo has a basic challenge in place so there is a point to play it other than finding out what we are up to.</p>
<p>So what is the demo and when is it going to be out? &#x2026;erm, the demo will be out pretty soon, but we don&#x2019;t want to give a date that we might not stick to. What we can say is that the first demo is based on one of our existing franchises, but not one that we have currently announced (so not the upcoming Cave Chaos or Hot Air follow ups).</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the rest of your Friday and have a great Weekend!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
