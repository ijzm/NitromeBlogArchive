                                                <p><strong>May 14th, 2013 -- Espoo, Finland --</strong> Rovio Entertainment announced the launch of its new mobile game publishing initiative, Rovio Stars, which will feature the best new games from talented and innovative developers. This is the entertainment company&#x2019;s first foray into including third party titles in its game line-up.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Rovio Entertainment has positioned itself as one of the powerhouses of mobile entertainment, so moving into publishing is a logical step for us at this point&#x201D;, said Rovio&#x2019;s EVP of Games Jami Laes. &#x201C;We want to help our fans find quality entertainment among the more than 100,000 games available in app stores. That&#x2019;s where Rovio Stars comes in.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the course of our work, we run into so many fantastic upcoming titles -- games with memorable characters and entertaining gameplay that are also just really fun to play!&#x201D; said Kalle Kaivola, Director of Development. &#x201C;These are the sorts of titles we&#x2019;re interested in. We want to help the developers to give these games that last coat of polish, publish the games and find their audience. We&#x2019;re focusing on a small, select number of games, and each Rovio Stars launch will be an event of its own.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The first game to be published under the Rovio Stars program will be Icebreaker: A Viking Voyage by Nitrome Ltd., followed by Tiny Thief by 5 Ants. Icebreaker: A Viking Voyage follows the adventure of a lone Viking, combining a unique ice slicing mechanic with an offbeat humour. Tiny Thief is a beautiful medieval adventure featuring stealth-based puzzles.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Being involved with Rovio Stars means that we have one of the best marketing teams behind us, as well as visibility to their vast audience. To a small indie studio like Nitrome this is all the backing we could hope for!&#x201D; said Mat Annal, Managing Director of Nitrome Ltd.</p>
