                                                <p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>We have been busy going through all of the great levels that you have sent in using the dev mode in <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/steamlands/" target="_blank">Steamlands</a>. Although there has been lots of levels that will make it into the game already, we feel that in order to get the balance right for an update, some feedback was required.</p>
<p>Our ideal plan for this update is to branch off in the map fairly early on with a new player route that starts off easy and gets harder just like in the original levels of the game.</p>
<p>We would like to see more levels which feature only content from earlier levels as well as the new weapons. Otherwise we will have to hold back the player levels from people that have only just started playing the game.</p>
<p>Some users have made levels with the emphasis of making visually compelling tanks with less focus on an idea that will make the levels fun to play. We applaud these tanks for being so spectacular, and may well make a gallery of them, but for a level to make it into the game we really want to see the emphasis on what makes the game fun and interesting to play.</p>
<p>To summarize, more easy levels that don&apos;t use elements from later in the game are really likely to make it earlier in the game and thus more visible. So if you want to get your levels seen then please send in levels like that :)</p>
<p>A big thank you to all the Nitromians that have sent in levels so far and we will keep you posted on the progress of the update!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
