                                                <p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>We&#x2019;re sorry we didn&apos;t bring you the <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/press/icebreaker-ios">Ice Breaker iOS</a> update this week. The game has been progressing at a good pace and we did have a plan for what we wanted to tell you about. Unfortunately our talented web developer Tom has been taking a well earned week off and as such it is a little hard for us to update the Ice Breaker page.</p>
<p>To give you a taste... we&#x2019;re planning to add a series of updates to the Ice Breaker page between now and the games release. They will serve to highlight some of the interesting aspects of the game that you may not know about as well as show you all that we are actually still working away at the game and making good progress.</p>
<p>The first update is going to be about what we actually meant by &apos;Side Quests&apos; which are not normal for a Physics puzzle game! We will do this by taking you through an example featuring the lovely looking goat in this week&apos;s Friday image!</p>
<p>So look forward to that and more next week, have a great Weekend!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
