                                                <p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>We have unfortunately not been able to put up a pixel Love for you yesterday as Tom who sorts that is ill. Sorry about that but hey sometimes people are ill right!</p>
<p>We have been looking at all of your feedback about <a title="Cheese Dreams: New Moon" href="/games/cheesedreamsnewmoon" target="_blank">Cheese Dreams: New Moon</a> in particular to a few bugs that people were pointing out to do with Avatars. We tried launching the new version yesterday but on testing it live, it seemed to crash so rapidly took it back down. JK is going to look at what is causing the issue and you should get the fix later today.</p>
<p>So this post was supposed to be about what we have fixed on Cheese Dreams but is now going to be about what we are fixing on Cheese Dreams so here we go:</p>
<p>We are fixing the bug that gives you the wrong Avatar when you collect the Planets&#x2026;.this was by far the main bug reported so we will be happy to get that one sorted</p>
<p>JK and Jon have been looking at some of the more performance heavy levels and bits of code and there has been some optimisation there. Some people reported that it ran slow so hopefully this will fix that.</p>
<p>There will also be a new sound fx for when you die falling off screen. Nobody actually reported this as an issue but it erked Jon and JK so they added it in!</p>
<p>We should have that up later today now... fingers crossed :0)</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
