                                                <p>Hi Nitromians!</p>
<p>We received an interesting letter yesterday issuing a cease and desist order on our <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/steamlands/" target="_blank">Steamlands</a> Game!!! Don&apos;t panic!</p>
<p>The issue in question was with regards to our choice of Dev Mode icon. For those of you that don&apos;t know, we felt it would be humorous to make the freshener icon look like an iconic car freshener which took the shape of a tree. We didn&apos;t realise however that this image is in fact trademarked and caused the previously mentioned letter to arrive on our doorstep.</p>
<p>While we are thrilled to see that the game has spread so well that they took notice, due to this, we have changed the icon to something more neutral. If you want to check out the icon, you can check it out here and for anyone that has taken the game, you can replace it with the new one from our recently added distribution page <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/distribution/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
