                                                <p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>for a long time now Nitrome have been experimenting with mobile. From the very beginning we were experimenting with unreleased mobile Chick Flick, there was the long time halted Super Feed Me and finally our Touchy app followed by our first finished mobile game Icebreaker. We&apos;re still going with Icebreaker on porting and updates but a few of you will recall that back before Icebreaker was released we also teased a top secret project on the mobile page at 25% complete.</p>
<p>When Rovio got involved as publisher of Icebreaker we needed more people on the team so that project was also put on hold while we finished it.</p>
<p>We did however have another team start work on a different game and they have since before the launch of Icebreaker be quietly working away at it. With all the false starts on mobile and with a general frustration from people who waited for Icebreaker following the initial announcement we have be wary of saying any more about the project until it is actually done.</p>
<p>I am happy to say we are getting closer to that point so when we can comfortably feel it is actually ready we will plan a marketing campaign and finally reveal it...this time at a much closer time to the actual release.</p>
<p>So is this a tease...sure it is but we thought you would like to know that we have been busy behind the scenes on something new!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
