<p><a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/steamlandsplayerpack/">Steamlands Player Pack</a> Released!</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce the release of our first ever player pack. This pack includes just as many levels as the original game (well, actually one short) for you to work your way through.</p>
<p>The levels feature the four new weapons that we added for you to play with and a lot of the levels made use of the final epic gun from the original game :)</p>
<p>We spent some time going through the levels to keep this update inline with the quality and pacing of the original. Many thanks to all those that contributed to the levels that made it into the game&#x2026;</p>
<p>You really excelled yourselves with the quality that you gave us and we were thrilled to get so many levels to choose from. If your level didn&#x2019;t make it into the pack, you may still find that your tanks made it into the new title screen which acts as a gallery of unused but often cool tanks&#x2026; check out those cranes and Nitrome tanks (personal fav&apos;s) :)</p>
<p>We hope you like this player pack. We may do another one if we keep getting levels. If it&#x2019;s popular, we may even add a dev mode in the odd game here and there in the future!</p>
