                                                <p>A few of you might have noticed that there were issues accessing the website last weekend. We are still unsure as to what caused these problems but they seem to be fully resolved now. We&apos;re really sorry for any inconvenience this might have caused. Thanks to everyone who emailed in to let us know about the problem! If any of you are still experiencing problems then please try clearing your browser cache and reloading the page. If the problems still persist then please contact us letting us know which pages are affected.<br><br>Following up from our last Works blog post we have now swapped over all of the games to the new website hosting. As we mentioned before this may effect the levels unlocked in these games but you should be able to retrieve them by following the steps listed <a href="http://cdn.nitrome.com/images/blog/retrieving_game_saves.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>On a positive note we now have all of the highscores in the games working again! <br><br>We should also be ready to launch a new game very soon.</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
