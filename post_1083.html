                                                <p class="MsoNormal">Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have added a few more people to the <a title="nitromejam" href="/jam" target="_blank">Nitrome&#xA0;Jam page</a> that have confirmed that they are getting involved in the Jam next week!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have added three confirmed Jammers who have made games we have featured in our Pixel Love in the past. <a title="raiyumi" href="http://raiyumi.com/" target="_blank">Raiyumi</a> who made &#x2018;<a title="the valley rule" href="/blog/articles/1066/" target="_blank">the Valley Rule</a>&#x2019; <a title="sinclairian" href="http://sinclairstrange.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank">Sinclairian</a> who made &#x2018;<a title="cathode" href="/games/pixellove/cathoderaybits/" target="_blank">Cathode Raybits</a>&#x2019; and <a title="bombocracker" href="http://bombocracker.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank">Bomb-O-Cracker</a> who made &#x2018;<a title="night lights" href="/games/pixellove/nightlights/" target="_blank">Night Lights</a>&#x2019;. Thrilled to have you on board guys.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have a few ex Nitrome members getting involved too that have since gone on to make their own studios. <a title="Iggy Zuk" href="http://www.iggyzuk.com/" target="_blank">Iggy Zuk</a> who went on to make <a title="Deadly 30" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/264730/" target="_blank">Deadly 30</a> for Steam will be heading back to Nitrome Towers. Going even further back in time we have Carl Trelfa who went on to form &#x2018;<a title="the podge" href="http://www.thepodge.co.uk/" target="_blank">the Podge</a>&#x2019; will be back too&#x2026;.I don&#x2019;t even think he has even been in our current office! It will be great to see you guys!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have added is <a title="wolve" href="http://wolvegames.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank">Wolve Games</a>. He is making one game a week and with a few weeks under his belt has decided to make one of them for the Nitrome Jam&#x2026;very cool!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally we added <a title="bonte" href="http://bartbonte.com/" target="_blank">Bart Bonte</a> who has made several games including the lovely <a title="sugar sugar" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sugar-sugar/id568141784?mt=8" target="_blank">Sugar Sugar</a> which is sort of like a cross between Sandman and Scribble and &apos;Where&apos;s My Water&apos;...great work!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is by no means an exhaustive list. There are tons of people that have signed up and that have shown interest beyond this! We are very humbled by the level of support we are seeing to the Jam and we hope everyone has a lot of fun and that we see some great little games at the end of it!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By the way if you haven&apos;t voted yet please be sure to view the last post :)</p>
