                                                <p>Drumroll please... time to reveal the second pay-for element that will be available in Twin Shot 2: Good and Evil. For a small fee you will have access to a series of super-cool cheats n&apos; treats. <br><br>Stuck on a level? Simple... skip to the next. Want to make things a little easier? Bang... just add a few more hearts for your character or turn on invincibility for a while. In fact while you&apos;re at it why not let your character fly for a while?<br><br>But I hear some of you saying: we don&apos;t want to make the game easier! Well that&apos;s ok we have stuff for you too! How would you like to play as a secret character? Have additional powerups? Make the game harder? Or maybe you just want to find out what fart-mode is?! Also there are some fun new multiplayer modes so if you like playing with a friend then this will enhance the experience.<br><br>Thanks for all of the feedback you have given us so far... it&apos;s ranged from the very enthusiastic to people who are a little more concerned. For the people who are concerned we just want to reinforce that this service will not detract from what we already do. Most games will remain completely free for the foreseeable future and any games that do use MochiCoins will contain a full complete experience equivalent to what you would normally expect from one of our games. You&apos;re not going to find yourself getting halfway through a game and then be asked to pay for more - the extras will all be self-contained level packs or extra features for people who just can&apos;t get enough of the initial content.<br><br>We would also like to point out that by buying extras you would be helping us to remain independant and will be helping fund new game development. We are hoping that through the funding these coins bring we will be able to offer more complex free and pay-for elements that we would never be able to offer before. <br><br>We&apos;re very excited about what the future holds... and we hope to continue making great games for all of you to play for a long time to come!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
