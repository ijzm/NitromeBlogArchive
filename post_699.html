<p>Hey Nitromians,</p>
<p>Many of you may be excited to see the return of our &#x2018;Memory Lane&#x2019; feature which hasn&#x2019;t made an appearance on our blog for quite a while.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s feature is a project we started way back in October 2009. It was abandoned in its early stages, simply because we didn&#x2019;t think it was much fun.</p>
<p>You may be interested to know that there have been a number of concepts that reach a playable build before deciding that they just aren&#x2019;t going to cut the mustard and go on to be a full release.</p>
<p>In this game codenamed &#x2018;Sucknblo&#x2019; we had a superhero protagonist who had a push beam device. His task was to clear a number of monster and trap based arenas using his push/pull ability.</p>
<p>You can see a full screenshot mock-up of the game&#xA0;<a href="http://cdn.nitrome.com/images/blog/sucknblow_blog_clickthrough.png" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Controls and loose concept were as follows (taken from the original game design document):</p>
<p>Use cursor keys or w,a,s,d to move. Space bar to fire your mega beam.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to kill all monsters on the screen.</p>
<p>The Push Beam:</p>
<p>Your laser will push at a monster till it loses its footing and then flies into a wall, crushed to death by the force of the beam or into a trap. Your laser is so powerful it slowly pulls in objects behind you as you fire it, so you must be careful not to pull monsters into you. Monsters will grab onto poles on the level to stop themselves being flung into a wall. Force fields and walls interrupt the range of your beam.</p>
<p>The bullets fired by the monsters and their basic patrolling behaviour are only a foundation for more complex and varied behaviours we intend to introduce and distribute amongst the player&apos;s enemies.</p>
<p>After mocking up the initial rough tech demo, we decided to close the door on this project and work on something else. It was the run up to Christmas at the time and we set to work on our penguin based toboggan game <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/avalanche/">&#x2018;Avalanche&#x2019;</a>, which may not have seen the light of day if it wasn&#x2019;t for the cancellation of this project.</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Jon</b></p>
