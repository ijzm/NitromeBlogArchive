<p>The website is currently undergoing some major changes in both our frontend and backend systems as from our last blog update and today I thought we&apos;d give you a quick progress update as to where we are with the redesign.</p>
<p>The website has been built, and now needs a few tweaks here and there. We have also been making room for even more functionality that we plan to add to the website after the initial launch.</p>
<p>I have got the &apos;hearting&apos; system working for the game pages which means you can help shape which of our games make it into the top five each day!</p>
<p>A backend system has also been created to help for making a website skin quicker, giving the artist more time to design those much loved skins and backgrounds!</p>

<p>We&#x2019;ve got the &#x2018;new games&#x2019; indicators working too, these will be used to show you which games you haven&#x2019;t played yet!</p>
<p>There&apos;s still a little bit more work to do including ironing out some browser bugs and updating the way we launch and update games. At the moment I am still coming across bugs that need tweaking regularly.</p>
<p>I&apos;m also updating the website&apos;s scroll functionality to make it more friendly to navigate!</p>
<p>We will bring you more soon!</p><p class="the-author">by <b>Tom</b></p></div>
