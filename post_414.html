                                                <p>A few of you mentioned that we didn&#x2019;t update the blog yesterday. We were a bit busy and never got round to it so sorry about that. It did however cause us to talk a little here about how we feel the blog is going and we have also been listening to your comments on<a href="http://www.facebook.com/nitrome" target="_blank"> Facebook</a>/<a href="http://www.twitter.com/nitrome" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.&#xA0;</p>
<p>It can be hard for us to find the time to make a very juicy story for you each day and there is also the need to update with some bits of news that may be less high profile. Our intent was by updating every day that the blog was more interesting but some feedback suggests that if it is not high profile news that it is resented. We think by committing to a post every day that we are feeding expectations that we can&#x2019;t meet so we have therefore decided to take a slightly different approach from here on out.</p>
<p>We will still be trying to provide as much up to date news as we have been but it will no longer necessarily be every day. Some days there may be none and others there may be more. We will review again in the future to see how this approach is received.</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
