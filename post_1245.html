                                                <p>Hey Nitromians,</p>
<p>As Gunbrick is rolling out tomorrow for mobile, we wanted to give your ears a little treat with a snippet of the games music. There are 12(ish) tracks in total and we must say that in our humble opinion it is some of the best music we have ever had produced. It&#x2019;s possibly even worth the price of the game just for the music alone!</p>
<p>Give it a listen here!</p>
<p><audio controls="controls"> <source src="media/gunbrick_music_teaser.ogg" type="audio/ogg"> <source src="media/gunbrick_music_teaser.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></p>
<p>For those of you who don&#x2019;t know, the music was produced by <a href="http://www.strotch.net/" target="_blank">Eirik Suhrke</a> producer of some of the most memorable tunes on mobile. Some of his works include Ridiculous Fishing, Spelunky and Super Crate Box. He also made a little tune for us in our latest game Platform Panic.</p>
<p>A neat little thing in Gunbrick is that the music starts after the protagonist has jumped into his brick and started the engine. It really makes it feel as though he has just switched the radio on and is thudding along to the music as he drives.</p>
<p>Keep your ears to the ground as Gunbrick heads your way tomorrow!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Nitrome</b></p>
