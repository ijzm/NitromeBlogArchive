<p>It\&apos;s live and you can go and play it now: <a href="\" http:="" www.nitrome.com="" games="" twinshot2="" \""="" target="\" _blank\""="">Twin Shot 2: Good and Evil</a><br><br>There are 50 Good levels to get through as well as some additional bonus levels you can find when you end a level with the Bonus powerup. Speaking of powerups you will want to try the new ones such as love arrows (which can be very infectious!). There are also a load of new monsters and traps to get firing at. Give the flying clouds a whirl... but watch out as the enemies can get in them too! There is a big boss battle at the end of the game so get your arrows ready for action!<br><br>If you like the Good levels (or if you finish them all and want more) in a first for our games you can actually purchase some more levels (a lot of people have requested this in the past so we finally found a way to do it). The Evil level pack is a whole new theme with 50 more levels featuring new monsters, traps, new music, a different boss battle and more! It costs 3000 MochiCoins for the Evil level pack which currently works out at $3.75 US Dollars (at the time of writing this works out at about 2.28 Pounds for the people in the UK and 2.64 EUR for our fans across Europe).<br><br>If you are stuck or you want to get even more out of the game in single or multiplayer mode then you might want to pick up the Cheats n Treats pack which has all kinds of goodies crammed in there. This is priced at 1000 MochiCoins which currently works out at $1.25 US Dollars (76 pence in the UK or 0.88 EUR across Europe). All prices are correct at the time of writing this but are subject to change over time.<br><br>There are several payment methods available and more should appear in the future. There are standard Credit Card and PayPal options, and there is SMS within the SuperRewards option for those of you wanting to pay on your mobile phone. Also using SuperRewards you are actually able to earn MochiCoins which can be used in Twin Shot 2 via a series of third-party advertisers offers. <br><br>To find out more about MochiCoins take a look at: <a href="\" http:="" www.mochigames.com="" help="" \""="" target="\" _blank\""="">http://www.mochigames.com/help/</a><br><br>Thanks to everyone who supports us in this - the money we make from this will go back into building even bigger and better games in the future!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
