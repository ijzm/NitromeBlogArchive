                                                <p>If you haven&#x2019;t heard we have a new web developer at Nitrome and he is going to be constantly working on new features for the website! His first work was on this new blog system which we think you will agree is pretty swanky but we hope what he has next in development is even better&#x2026;&#x2026;drum roll&#x2026;.a whole new site design!!!</p>
<p>Here is a preview shot of how we&apos;re hoping to make the site look. As you can see it is an evolution of our old design but it is one which we hope will add a lot of functionality and which we hope is also more pleasing to the eye :)</p>
<p>There are some features planned for the future of the site that we are not ready to reveal yet and so there are a few areas of the shot that we have purposely pixeled out&#x2026;..that is intended and is not part of the new site design! We will leave it to your imagination as to what those new features might be!</p>
<p>It is always a concern to change elements such as layout and styles in a popular games site. We hope you like what you see but if you do have comments on what you think of the new design please do feel free to drop us an email, comment on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/nitrome" target="_blank">facebook</a> page or tweet to our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nitrome" target="_blank">twitter</a> page as we would love to get some feedback.</p>
