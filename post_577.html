<p>Hi Nitromians!</p>
<p>We are very excited to reveal just what&#x2019;s going to be appearing under that &#x2018;Coming Soon&#x2019; panel in the top right hand corner of our site. As has been suspected and requested by many people, we are going to have a new login system for the site!</p>
<p>This is going to be a completely optional feature. If you choose not to use it you will be able to play the games as you could before but we will be introducing (both at launch and going forward) tons of cool new features made possible through logging in!</p>
<p>You may also notice that we have a new search bar coming to the site. This too has been a highly requested feature for a while that we will be happy to deliver :)</p>
<p>It has been no small undertaking to bring these features to life in a site as established as Nitrome. A lot of ground work has had to be done and has caused us to take longer than initially planned. Hopefully at launch you will appreciate the effort that has been made and will be able to enjoy a more stable and feature rich Nitrome site in the future.</p>
<p>We will be giving a full lowdown on what to expect in the Nitrome 2.1 update next week so stay tuned!</p>
