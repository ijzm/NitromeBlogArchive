<p>We know that we didn&apos;t give out a &apos;Friday Update&apos; last week, so here is a quick bit of catch up information for you all!</p>
<p>We&apos;re currently working very hard to bring you some of the new games we have got in development. We know it has taken a little longer than our usual releases do, however we feel that when you see the game, you will understand where the time has been spent! :)</p>
<p>Some of you have also noticed that we are currently approaching our 100th game! This has also been taking a lot of our time and we will be very thrilled to show you what we have been doing when the time comes.</p>
<p>To avoid any confusion that people might have or how they have speculated, by our calculations, we consider our next game to be our 98th game so there will be two more games before the 100th game and any Steamlands update would not be included in the count. Also just to note that we have purposely not shown anything with regards to the 100th game... It&apos;s a secret! :)</p>
<p>Stay tuned for our next game coming very soon!</p><p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p></div>
