                                                <p>Time for some more juicy info about our upcoming Twin Shot sequel...<br><br>We were recently invited by the talented folk at MochiMedia to be among the first developers to try out their new micro-transaction system called <a href="https://www.mochigames.com/" target="_blank">MochiCoins</a>. We are excited to announce that Twin Shot 2 is going to be our first game to include pay-for extras powered by that system.<br><br>So what does this mean?<br><br>It means that while you will still get the same amount of great free content that you have come to expect from Nitrome, there will also be extra content that can be purchased for those of you who are looking for a little more. MochiCoins should allow us to try new things in our flash games that we otherwise wouldn&apos;t be able to condone spending time on so I hope you will be as excited as we are to see what we come up with!<br><br>In Twin Shot 2 we are currently planning two new items, the first of which will be an additional level pack. This &quot;evil&quot; pack will contain 50 additional levels, more new monsters, more new traps, a new boss, new &quot;evil&quot; music and more. We also have a second item which we will reveal at a later date :)<br><br>We are trialing the system and we don&apos;t intend to use it in every game. What we are hoping to do is try it in different ways over a few titles to best find out the sort of things you all want to see. If you have any requests or feedback on the game once it is released then we would love to hear what you think.<br><br>You can see a shot of one of the new &quot;evil&quot; levels <a href="http://cdn.nitrome.com/images/blog/twin_shot_2_evil.png" target="_blank">here</a>. More news coming soon!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
