                                                <p>Hi Nitromians,</p>
<p>I don&apos;t mean to keep posting every day any more but we do seem to have a lot of noteworthy events to get out there...so erm I still am...but it will stop soon I promise!</p>
<p>Today we have a new fan made project that we became aware of over the Christmas Break and it is a little special! User &apos;Sim&apos; has managed to make his own level editor for our game Square Meal....impressive!</p>
<p>It&apos;s online <a title="Squaremeal" href="http://fiddle.jshell.net/Sim533/S9pc6/show/" target="_blank">here</a>&#xA0;so anyone can use it to make levels but a limitation is that you can&apos;t test them without Sim manually putting them into the game. The good news is that he is doing just that and already has 50 of them! We will be interested to see what people come up with!</p>
<p>We have worked on two fan collaborations in the past at Nitrome...there was our Steamlands editor which spawned the <a title="Steamlands PP" href="/games/steamlandsplayerpack/" target="_blank">Steamlands Player Pack</a> and <a title="Skywire VIP extended" href="/games/skywirevipextended" target="_blank">Skywire VIP Extended</a> where two fans had recreated the entire game in Scratch and made an entirely new set of characters. We then worked with them to put their characters and clues into a real new addition to the game that lives on the Nitrome Website.</p>
<p>We are unsure yet given that players can&apos;t test levels if the quality of the levels will be sufficiently good...at the moment they seem very hard (I only got to level 3). But you guys have a habit of surprising us and if Sim is up for it and if you can make 50 good levels then Nitrome would be open to launching the levels as an official player pack.&#xA0;</p>
<p>So challenge set....lets see what you do :)</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
