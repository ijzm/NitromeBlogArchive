                                                <p>So you read our huge news about having Icebreaker: A Viking Voyage published by Rovio Stars?</p>
<p>Update#7: <a href="http://www.icebreaker-game.com/updates.html" target="_self">Rovio Stars?</a></p>
<p>When we started Icebreaker we had no intention of using a publisher. We were not looking for a publisher and even though we had interest from several of the biggest publishers during its development it wasn&apos;t really what we wanted.</p>
<p>So what changed? Well nothing really... but there are exceptions to every rule. In the paid app market Rovio is king, they have taken their Angry Birds game and made it a phenomenon and every game they have released has gone on to be very successful. We have a huge respect for what they have built up and they are possibly the only party on the App store that we would and did jump at working with.</p>
<p>The App Store is all about exposure, games are cheap so you need lots and lots... and LOTS of people to know about your game in order to get up the charts. It&apos;s only once you chart that anyone outside your fan base will ever hear about you!</p>
<p>As of last December Rovio has a user base of 200 million monthly active users... that&apos;s seriously huge! To give you an idea of how huge, that&apos;s more than Twitter has! By comparison Nitrome has around 5 million monthly active users, something we&#x2019;re proud of but not all of those will even own a phone and well&#x2026; you see the difference!</p>
<p>So what about compromising the game? Well that&#x2019;s the other great thing&#x2026; we don&apos;t! The game was fairly feature complete before Rovio got involved and they were impressed with what we had done. Everything that we changed after that point enhanced the game and we fully appreciated and agreed with their feedback.</p>
<p>Because of Rovio the game has been tested to death. Not only is it about as bug free as we could possibly make a game it also had a lot of user testing. We got lots of great feedback from this and we were able to adjust areas that people were getting confused or to make some elements more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Also thanks Rovio were thrilled to announce that Icebreaker is not only in English but also at launch supports French, German, Spanish and Italian!</p>
<p>Icebreaker: A Viking Voyage features an in depth dialogue throughout the game conveying a deep and often humorous tale. It is a feature we spent a lot of time on in the game and one of the features that we believe elevates the game above what you would typically find in a puzzle game on the App Store.</p>
<p>Rovio have helped us with the branding and we worked closely to create a new video and art to be used to promote the game. If you haven&#x2019;t seen the video yet what are you waiting for? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=HCvLhe8ReGA" target="_blank">Go view it now!</a></p>
<p>The other major benefit of working with Rovio is that they know better than anyone else on the App Store how to take a hit brand to the next level. There is everything now from the familiar Angry Birds plush toys, to a cartoon series and feature film on the way.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Now don&apos;t get too excited, you may not ever see such things from the Icebreaker universe. But if we do have a hit on our hands, then Rovio will help us make the most of it in a way we never could have done on our own!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
