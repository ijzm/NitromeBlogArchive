<p>And the demo is for... ...drum roll.....</p>
<p>...A new <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/cheesedreamsdemo/">Cheese Dreams</a> Title!</p>
<p>Looking back, we are pleased with what we did with Cheese Dreams and our initial idea was to make a follow up to the game. The first game was difficult&#x2026;.in retrospect probably too difficult and we felt that a lot of people would not have made it to the end of the game.</p>
<p>Without giving too much away it would mean setting the second game in a different location and most people would not understand the reason for it. We love the world we created with the first game so in order to fully explore what happens next we wanted to first give a new version of the original that people would have a better chance of making it through... then go on to show what happens next.</p>
<p>Although the game is a remake it has got all new levels which incorporate both the elements from the original and much, much more!</p>
<p>The game also has an all-new, full physics engine. It is this change in particular that we want to show off to you in the demo to see if you like the feel or what suggestions you may have that could affect the final release.</p>
<p>Have Fun and let us know what you think over at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/nitrome" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nitrome" target="_blank">Twitter!</a></p>
