                                                <p>Nitrome always tries to put some effort into the run up for Christmas and this year, despite being spread more thinly than ever between flash and iOS, we do have some nice plans for you. Mostly we&apos;re keeping things under wraps as to what those plans are for now but lets just say we&apos;re working on a very popular sequel!</p>
<p>Before that we&apos;re still planning to get Cheese Dreams New Moon out. Because of the sheer size of the project and the timeframe, we have decided to put it out in two parts, one coming soon before the Christmas plans and one soon a little after Christmas. We&apos;re sure you will be very happy with both parts and the first one is looking great and you could see in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMIQJAClCME" target="_blank">Cheese Dreams New Moon trailer</a> we put out earlier.</p>
<p>Both the Icebreaker update and the Android build are coming along, with the current plan all going well that we can launch them at the same time. We want to say that there is a slim chance this could be in December still but it is now looking more likely that it might slip to early next year. Unfortunately with something as big as Icebreaker there are endless amounts of bugs and testing that need to be done.</p>
<p>We have a few other top secret things going on at Nitrome. Of special note in this post, the first one should be revealed on the 1st of December! Oh and we should have a new winter skin too... ohhhhhh!</p>
<p>Have a great weekend; we will see you all next week!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
