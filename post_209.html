                                                <p>A few of you might have noticed we haven&apos;t had a game up for a little longer than usual.......thanks for all the emails :) Although we actually had a game ready that was intended to be launched we agreed with the games sponsor that it would be better positioned for a particular event later in the year so it has been held back. The eagle-eyed amongst you may even be able to take a guess as to some of the games contents and the event from the latest skin!<br><br>Fear not however as we have some great new games that should be ready for release really soon now so your not going to waiting long for your next hot games fix. To tide you over until then we felt it was about time we launched a new minigame to test your high score skills :) This one has been sitting around gathering dust at Nitrome towers for a while now so it is great to finally find a good time to release it. <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/cosmiccannon/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to play <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/cosmiccannon/" target="_blank">Cosmic Cannon</a>.<br><br>The aim of the game is to keep a number ball in the air for as many bounces as possible by shooting new balls into it. Watch out for balls featuring cameos from some of our other games.....they may look nice but they will only get in your way and they don&apos;t count towards your score so try to get rid of them quickly! Don&apos;t worry if you drop one you can just keep restarting until you think you have a score worth submitting......Good Luck!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
