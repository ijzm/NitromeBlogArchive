                                                <p>A long time ago we announced and gave you a <a href="/games/cheesedreamsdemo/" target="_self">demo</a> of a remake of one of our older games <a href="/games/cheesedreams/" target="_self">Cheese Dreams</a> and then nothing!&#xA0;</p>
<p>The game was fairly far into development but various other projects meant we had to put it on hold and then (even more) various other projects stopped us coming back to it. We&apos;re thrilled to finally let you all know that we are now back working on it!</p>
<p>The game now has a proper title &apos;<a href="http://cdn.nitrome.com/images/uploads/938-1380034177-cheesedreams-newmoon-fs.png" target="_blank">Cheese Dreams: New Moon</a>&apos; which we think covers well what the project is. For those who maybe don&apos;t know what this is about here is a recap.</p>
<p>Cheese Dreams: New Moon is a remake of our 2007 game &apos;Cheese Dreams&apos;. It has the same basic bouncing mechanic but remade in a new engine that now supports full physics for all game elements rather than a few hard coded ones. It has the same mouse ship setting and basic story and shares some elements but beyond that is a brand new game that could be considered a sequel if it weren&apos;t for having the same storyline. If your still not clear then trying out both the demo and the original game should give you a good idea of the difference.</p>
<p>So why did we decide to remake it and not make a sequel? ...for fans of the original there is an obvious direction for a sequel given at the end of the game. We love the concept of the Moon being abducted by mice and although we would love to explore what happens next the general feeling was that so much time had passed that people in general would not remember what happened in the original particularly as it was a pretty hard game to beat.</p>
<p>The project is still a little while off so don&apos;t expect it in a week or two!</p>
<p>Although we did a lot of work on this before it was put on hold the fact is that the game had became bloated with content and elements, so much so that making the levels and finishing off the art and code for what is already there is still quite a big task! Jon went through everything that has been built for the new project and said there was already enough for two projects worth of content!...in fact we may put the project out in two parts both to get this out quicker and so as to not waste any elements!</p>
<p>At the time of writing this it is intended to be the next browser game after Test Subject Arena 2 so that should give you a rough idea of the timescale we&apos;re looking at.</p>
<p>To wrap up we wanted to share one tip bit of info in this post. In Cheese Dreams: New Moon your going to not only see the moon but also some other planets too....hmmm how mysterious!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
