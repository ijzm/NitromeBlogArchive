<p>This is what we are proposing to have in the version 2.1 update. Some things are subject to change as the site develops and takes shape but this is what we are aiming towards and hope to achieve in 2.1</p>
<p><strong>Login System and Accounts</strong></p>
<p>You will be able to create a Nitrome account. You can also log into the system using your Facebook or Twitter account. You will have the ability to link your Facebook and Twitter to a Nitrome account to utilise the features of each system.</p>
<p><strong>Avatars System</strong></p>
<p>You will be able to select from a range of Nitrome characters to represent you as your avatar. There will also be more avatars that can be found in games and around the site. Some may also be rewarded for completing tasks. This ground work with avatars will both be expanded in future updates and form the backbone for a potential achievements based system.</p>
<p><strong>Search System</strong></p>
<p>You will be able to search through our games, blog posts and find users by using a brand new search bar.</p>
<p><strong>Friends System</strong></p>
<p>You can send friend requests to any users that you see on Nitrome be it from a blog post or high score. You can manually enter a friend&#x2019;s user name to find them on Nitrome and send a request. You can search for a user via a user name, email address or any other details that they add to their account including usernames from other gaming platforms. You can also invite friends from Twitter and Facebook if you have chosen to link your accounts to Nitrome. You can also accept friend requests from other people.</p>
<p><strong>Profiles</strong></p>
<p>Your profile will include your friends list, avatar list, chosen avatar, recently played games, hearted games list, comments and your Nitrome number.</p>
<p>You will also be able to view other people&#x2019;s public profile page information.</p>
<p><strong>Hearting System</strong></p>
<p>When you heart Nitrome games they will be added to your hearted games list, you will be able to see a list of your hearted games so others can see which of our games you like the most.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting System</strong></p>
<p>You will be able to comment on our blog posts, our games and reply to other user&#x2019;s comments.</p>
<p><strong>Games</strong></p>
<p>There will be a high scores update that will tie to the friends system (we will roll this out on a per game basis).</p>
<p>You will be able to save game information to accounts. This will be in new games, a selection of existing games and will be added to older games over time (Generally the newer the game and or the more popular the game will dictate the order in which they get updated).</p>
<p>This will work in harmony with the current save system that doesn&#x2019;t require a login. If you do not want to log in, you don&#x2019;t have to and the game information will save as before. The new system however will work to prevent your saves from getting lost as may happen when relying on the limitation inherent in shared objects. Login saves will not require users to recomplete start games from scratch as it can get data from your shared objects. Users will be able to access their account from any PC so no need to start from scratch there either :)</p>
<p>We will also start tagging the games that you have completed but this will not be visualised in the 2.1 update.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong></p>
<p>You will have the ability to link your Facebook account to Nitrome. This will allow us to tie our high scores with your Facebook. We will also allow you to filter the scores to let you see who has the best scores out of you and your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>
<p>You will have the ability to you to link your Twitter account to Nitrome. This will allow us to let you express your score that you achieved for a game and tell your Twitter followers</p>
<p><strong>Visual Revamps</strong></p>
<p>There will be a few minor revamps to the functionality and visuals of the existing pages.</p>
<p>We are really excited about the features that we are currently working on and hope to bring them to you in the near future!</p>                <p class="the-author">by <b>Mat</b></p>
